There are so many people you will meet who will motivate you, urge you and even persuade you to get a website. A couple of Google searches and you will start viewing advertisements about it - everywhere, and marketing people hunting you down. It can get frustrating! So, this question will definitely come to your mind - Why should I have a website?  Do I really need it? Well, a simple answer to the question is - Yes, you need it. Because..

## #5 Youâ€™ll show up in Google search results.
Everyone has got a nice smart phone with Internet connection in it. In this busy world, expecting someone to come to your office by looking at your address in your visiting card seems far fetched. Most often than not, they will search for you - online. If you haven't got a website you are in bad luck, because they won't find you. When they won't find you, your credibility will take a deep plunge.
## #4 A website builds credibility.
When people discover that you have a website, they perceive you as a company that is serious about business. If you have got a great professional looking website with up-to-date informations, your potential customer will feel assured and satisfied about your business. 

## #3 A website sells your products/services online 24/7.
With your website, you can showcase your products and services 24/7. Whenever someone comes to your website, he/she can see what you are offering and get information about it. All this without you having to spend money on a marketing person. You can sell your products even when you are sleeping. You never know - Some of your clients may like shopping late-night when it is quieter.

## #2 A website helps you connect with new customers.
Local business have geographical constraints. There are limited number of people living nearby, hence limited customers. Come online and you get almost unlimited market. You get access to customers living far and wide. All you need to do is to tap into this market and see your business shine!

## #1 Websites are affordable.
If we consider all the benefits of having a website and the cost involved in having one, you will find that having a website is cheap, very cheap. It all depends on how much you are willing to spend. If you low on budget - you can get a basic website at just 10-15k(in India). If you can spend some more bucks - you can have custom made, designer website under 50k. These are one time rates. Going ahead you just need to renew the domain name and hosting package which may cost you around 2-3k per year. Think about it.. Even a decent mobile phone costs more!
