title: Hello World!

> Where thou art there is love. -Emily Dickinson 

www is a work of art, a magic that makes people fall in love with it. It has been a part of my life since I was first introduced to it. It was a humble beginning when my friend Rishav Sharma made me my orkut profile. It was long time ago.

When we love something and immerse ourself in it our lives start revolving around it. This love for web motivated me to learn more about it and do nice things with it. I have been playing with it and developing websites and applications for 5 years now. It is my passion, my love and my carrer.

I am developing this personal site to share with you my personal and professional views, resources and projects. It will be fun.
