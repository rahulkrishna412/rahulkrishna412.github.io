Ansacons is a constuction company which specializes in building residential complexes in addition to various infrastructure projects.

The requirement was to build a lightweight and respnsive website which can be accessed from any device. The website should open well on mobile devices. The website had to look modern and beautiful yet professional and corporate.

The design was done using Adobe Photoshop and later converted to HTML5/CSS3. Responsiveness was achieved by building the site on top of bootstrap and AngularJS. Drupal 7 was used as the CMS to manage the website.
